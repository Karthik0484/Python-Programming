# ðŸ”´ Q5. Create a polymorphic employee payment system ðŸ’³
# Write a class Employee with subclasses Intern, Developer, Manager.
# Each should have a method calculate_salary() returning different salaries.
# Then create a payroll function that takes a list of employee objects and printsÂ their salary
